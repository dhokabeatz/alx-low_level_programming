# 0x17 Doubly Linked Lists

This project focuses on the implementation and manipulation of doubly linked lists in C programming. A doubly linked list is a data structure where each node contains two pointers: one pointing to the previous node and another pointing to the next node. This additional link provides more flexibility and efficient traversal in both directions compared to a singly linked list.

The project consists of various tasks that involve creating, inserting, deleting, and manipulating nodes in a doubly linked list. By completing these tasks, I will gain a deeper understanding of the concepts and operations related to doubly linked lists.

The project tasks cover essential operations such as adding nodes at the beginning and end of the list, deleting nodes, calculating the length of the list, and printing the list in both forward and reverse orders. Additionally, I will work on more advanced tasks that involve sorting the list and performing specific operations on the list nodes.

Throughout the project, I will practice using C programming language features, such as memory allocation, pointer manipulation, and pointer arithmetic, to implement the required functionality for the doubly linked lists.

By successfully completing the tasks in this project, I will enhance my knowledge and proficiency in working with linked lists, gain a deeper understanding of doubly linked lists, and strengthen my skills in C programming.
