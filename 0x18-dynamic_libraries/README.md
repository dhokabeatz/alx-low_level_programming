# 0x18 Dynamic Libraries

The 0x18 Dynamic Libraries project focuses on the concept of dynamic libraries in the C programming language. Dynamic libraries, also known as shared libraries, are pre-compiled pieces of code that can be dynamically loaded and linked to an executable at runtime.

In this project, I will explore the creation and usage of dynamic libraries to enhance the modularity and reusability of code. By creating dynamic libraries, I can separate commonly used functions into standalone libraries that can be shared across multiple programs. This promotes code reuse, simplifies code maintenance, and reduces the overall size of executable files.

Throughout the project, I will learn how to create dynamic libraries using the appropriate compiler flags and linker options. I will also discover how to link these libraries with executable programs, enabling the programs to access the functions and symbols defined in the dynamic libraries.

By engaging with the 0x18 Dynamic Libraries project, I will gain a deeper understanding of the benefits and mechanisms of dynamic libraries. I will learn how to create, compile, and link dynamic libraries, as well as how to handle library dependencies and manage versioning.

Furthermore, this project will expose me to the dynamic loading and symbol resolution mechanisms provided by the operating system. I will learn how to use tools such as `dlopen`, `dlsym`, and `dlclose` to dynamically load libraries, retrieve function pointers, and unload libraries during runtime.

Overall, the 0x18 Dynamic Libraries project offers a comprehensive exploration of dynamic libraries and their usage in C programming. By mastering dynamic libraries, I will enhance my programming skills, improve code organization, and gain a deeper understanding of the modular design principles that underpin software development.
