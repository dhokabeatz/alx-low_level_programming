# ALX Low-Level Programming

This repository contains my solutions to the low-level programming projects at ALX. These projects focus on developing a strong understanding of the fundamentals of C programming language and low-level concepts.

## Projects

1. 0x00-hello_world: Introduction to C programming, compilation process, and basic syntax.
2. 0x01-variables_if_else_while: Variables, if-else statements, and loops in C programming.
3. 0x02-functions_nested_loops: Functions, nested loops, and header files in C programming.
4. 0x03-debugging: Debugging techniques and tools in C programming.
5. 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops: More functions and nested loops in C programming.
6. 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings: Pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming.
7. 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings: More pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming.
8. 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings: Even more pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming.
9. 0x08-recursion: Recursion and recursive functions in C programming.
10. 0x09-static_libraries: Creating and using static libraries in C programming.
11. 0x0A-argc_argv: Command line arguments and argc/argv in C programming.
12. 0x0B-malloc_free: Dynamic memory allocation using malloc and free in C programming.
13. 0x0C-more_malloc_free: More dynamic memory allocation using malloc and free in C programming.
14. 0x0D-preprocessor: Preprocessor directives and macros in C programming.
15. 0x0E-structures_typedef: Structures and typedef in C programming.
16. 0x0F-function_pointers: Function pointers and their usage in C programming.
17. 0x10-variadic_functions: Variadic functions and their usage in C programming.
18. 0x12-singly_linked_lists: Singly linked lists and their manipulation in C programming.

Each project directory contains a variety of tasks and their corresponding solutions. The solutions are implemented in C programming language and follow the ALX coding style guidelines.
