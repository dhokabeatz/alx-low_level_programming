# 0x15 File I/O

The 0x15 File I/O project explores the concepts and operations related to file input/output in the C programming language. File I/O is a fundamental aspect of working with external files, allowing programs to read data from files, write data to files, and perform various file manipulation operations.

This project consists of several tasks that involve reading from and writing to files, as well as performing specific operations on file content. Through these tasks, I will gain hands-on experience with file handling techniques and understand how to interact with files using file descriptors and standard library functions.

The project tasks cover a range of file I/O operations, including opening and closing files, reading and writing text or binary data, manipulating file positions, and error handling. I will also work on tasks that involve copying the contents of one file to another and creating a program that can be used as a simple shell.

By completing the tasks in this project, I will deepen my understanding of file I/O concepts, enhance my skills in working with file descriptors and standard library functions, and become more proficient in handling file operations in C programming.

Overall, the 0x15 File I/O project provides an opportunity to gain practical experience in file I/O operations, enabling me to work with external files, process their contents, and perform various file-related tasks efficiently.
